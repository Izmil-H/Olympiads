given a number line with points, find a location with the miniumum sum distance:
    --> the answer is always the median of the points.


bruce draws lines extending from the people representing a graph of the distance and time.

the graph on the left represents the sum distance as the concert location moves along the number line

so it IS binary search. he compares the middle-left with middle-left + 1
